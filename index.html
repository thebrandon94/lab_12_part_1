<h1>Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</h1>
<p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Who are you, my warranty?! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</p>
<h2>Raging Bender</h2>
<p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts!</li>
<li>Negative, bossy meat creature!</li>
<li>Tell them I hate them.</li>
<li>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?</h3>
<p>Meh. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? I love you, buddy! Bite my shiny metal ass. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go&hellip; look for more stuff to steal!</p>
<h4>Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings</h4>
<p>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! No! Don't jump! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</p>
<ol>
<li>Noooooo!</li>
<li>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</li>
<li>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h5>
<p>Large bet on myself in round one. Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! No argument here.</p>
